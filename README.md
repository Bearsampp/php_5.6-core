# This repo is for winbinder vc11 ( php 5.6 ) only!!!!

If using Visual studio 2012 Ultimate this image is wrong in that it doesn't seem possible to pin a command to the start menu.  You'll have to use ```command prompt``` in the search box which opens a terminal in the visual studio 11 path.
You'll then need to cd to this repo from the terminal.

* the source for visual studio 2012 can be found in ```/fork-of-how-to/php-5.6-xp/downloads/```
* Modern winbinder repo is https://github.com/wagy/WinBinder?tab=readme-ov-file
* ```fork-of-how-to```  is a clone of the winbinder for php 5.6.24 repo.  I've created "our" working build stuff in the root so the ```fork-of-how-to``` is an archival folder so if the source repo is lost we have a backup.
