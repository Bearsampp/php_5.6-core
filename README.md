# This repo is for vc11 php 5.6 only!!!!

This will contain all sources and instructions we can find in maintaining the php lib used in Bearsampp core.
You have to use ```command prompt``` in the search box which opens a terminal in the visual studio 11 path.
You'll then need to cd to this repo from the terminal.

* the source for visual studio 2012 can be found in ```[Our releases](https://github.com/Bearsampp/php_5.6-winbinder.dll/releases/download/2024.4.3/en_visual_studio_express_2012_for_windows_desktop_x86_dvd_1001986.iso)```
* Modern winbinder repo is https://github.com/wagy/WinBinder?tab=readme-ov-file
* ```sources```  is a clone of the winbinder for php 5.6.24 repo.  I've created "our" working build stuff in the root so the ```sources``` is an archival folder so if the source repo is lost we have a backup.
